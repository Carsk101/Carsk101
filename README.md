# Hey, I'm Harsh.

I like to build things. AI tools, voice agents, random projects that seem interesting.

## Background

Finance and entrepreneurship background. Most of what I know came from being curious and figuring stuff out.

I'm into understanding how things work. Systems, patterns, why things are the way they are. When something bugs me, I build a better version.

## What I Build

Stuff that's useful and interesting. AI agents, behavior analysis, automation, systems-level tools. If it solves a real problem or teaches me something new, I'm probably working on it.

---

When I'm not building, I'm probably reading, listening to music, or going down some rabbit hole.
